//get random input from computer from three choice - 'Rock','Paper','Scissor' in a function 'getComputerChoice'
//get input from user using prompt 
//make a function that uses two parameters - computer choice and player choice, and plays a game of RockPaperScissors and returns a string that declares winner or tie 
//repeat the previous function 5 times inside a new function which counts the result of each game and displays the result at the end

//---------------------------------------------
//ask for confirmation if user want to play the game or not
//get input from user using prompt

//get random value from computer using following-
//define 'rock', 'paper', 'scissor' in a array
//get a random value from the array using mathsfloor(mathsrandom*arraylength) method
//store it in different variable

//write a function which take two parameter, one of user and one of computer
//this function determine the winner based on the principles of RockPaperScissors game-
//Rock beat scissors
//Paper beat Rock
//Scissor beak Paper
//or Tie
//make two different variables where each of them store either user or computer's number of win
//after determining the winner, the function return a string that declares the winner of tie of round like: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

//make a new function which contain the previous loop inside it and play it 5 times, let's say using loop and at the end declares the winner 

//ask if you want to play again and starts the madness again
